# CommuniPrep  
> “Master your interviews with our storytelling guide to land your dream job.” 

## Overview 
Many students struggle to communicate their qualifications effectively during job interviews, despite 
having strong skills. This challenge arises from a gap between their academic knowledge and their 
ability to express  it professionally.  A  simple  storytelling framework,  combined  with body  language 
and  communication  tips,  helps  students  structure  their  answers  clearly,  boost  confidence,  and 
improve presentation skills, ensuring they convey their abilities and succeed in interviews.
