## **Project Name**: CommuniPrep



### Selected Prototype: Desktop

We chose to select the desktop version of our application because it is more similar to a real environment. 
We wanted to make the user feel like in a call with an HR, so sitting in front of a pc is more realistic for this purpose.

Moreover, the bigger screen of a desktop pc allows to put more information all at once.
So the user, in the same moment, can see a big box with the avatar/HR, receive accurate feedback 
either about his/her answers to the questions and about his/her body language and gestures, 
and lastly he/she can also see himself in another box to have a reference of how he/she behaves during the interview


### Two selected Screens:
1. Home Page
    - The Home Page was selected because it is the first point of interaction, allowing users to select a job role and customize their  interview before starting that, also have access to all other pages.
2. Interview Page
    - The Interview Page was selected because it is the core functionality of the application, providing users to practice by answering questions and receive real-time feedback on their answers and body language.

## Plans for the hi-fi prototype (Assignment 5)


We plan to implement new features to solve usability issues and enhance user experience. We will focus on resolving all reported major heuristic violations with severity levels 3 and 4 in the high-fidelity prototype. Each issue will be carefully analyzed, and appropriate solutions will be implemented to align with usability principles. If the team disagrees with any reported violation, we will provide a clear justification for why it is being disregarded. Any violations with severity levels 1 and 2 that are simple will also be fixed to enhance usability.

Based on the heuristic evaluations we received, we have identified a set of new features to be added across the application. These features will address both existing usability gaps and enhance functionality. The planned features for each section are as follows:
